# Movie_Database_Application

Create a Movie Database Application in 15 Minutes with ASP.NET MVC (C#)
(For this you need Visual Studio 2010)

The purpose of this tutorial is to give you a sense of "what it is like" to build an ASP.NET MVC application. In this tutorial, I blast through building an entire ASP.NET MVC application from start to finish. I show you how to build a simple database-driven application that illustrates how you can list, create, and edit database records.

To simplify the process of building our application, we'll take advantage of the scaffolding features of Visual Studio 2008. We'll let Visual Studio generate the initial code and content for our controllers, models, and views.

If you have worked with Active Server Pages or ASP.NET, then you should find ASP.NET MVC very familiar. ASP.NET MVC views are very much like the pages in an Active Server Pages application. And, just like a traditional ASP.NET Web Forms application, ASP.NET MVC provides you with full access to the rich set of languages and classes provided by the .NET framework.

My hope is that this tutorial will give you a sense of how the experience of building an ASP.NET MVC application is both similar and different than the experience of building an Active Server Pages or ASP.NET Web Forms application.

Overview of the Movie Database Application
Because our goal is to keep things simple, we'll build a very simple Movie Database application. Our simple Movie Database application will allow us to do three things:

List a set of movie database records
Create a new movie database record
Edit an existing movie database record
Again, because we want to keep things simple, we'll take advantage of the minimum number of features of the ASP.NET MVC framework needed to build our application. For example, we won't be taking advantage of Test-Driven Development.

In order to create our application, we need to complete each of the following steps:

Create the ASP.NET MVC Web Application Project
Create the database
Create the database model
Create the ASP.NET MVC controller
Create the ASP.NET MVC views
Preliminaries
You'll need either Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Web Developer 2010 Express to build an ASP.NET MVC application. You also need to download the ASP.NET MVC framework.

If you don't own Visual Studio 2010, then you can download a 90 day trial version of Visual Studio 2010 from this website:

Alternatively, you can create ASP.NET MVC applications with Visual Web Developer Express 2010. If you decide to use Visual Web Developer Express then you must have Service Pack 1 installed. You can download Visual Web Developer 2008 Express with Service Pack 1 from this website:

After you install either Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Web Developer 2010, you need to install the ASP.NET MVC framework. You can download the ASP.NET MVC framework from the following website:
