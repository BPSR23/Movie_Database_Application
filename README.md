# Movie_Database_Application

Create a Movie Database Application in 15 Minutes with ASP.NET MVC (C#)
(For this you need Visual Studio 2010)

The purpose of this tutorial is to give you a sense of "what it is like" to build an ASP.NET MVC application. In this tutorial, I blast through building an entire ASP.NET MVC application from start to finish. I show you how to build a simple database-driven application that illustrates how you can list, create, and edit database records.

To simplify the process of building our application, we'll take advantage of the scaffolding features of Visual Studio 2008. We'll let Visual Studio generate the initial code and content for our controllers, models, and views.

If you have worked with Active Server Pages or ASP.NET, then you should find ASP.NET MVC very familiar. ASP.NET MVC views are very much like the pages in an Active Server Pages application. And, just like a traditional ASP.NET Web Forms application, ASP.NET MVC provides you with full access to the rich set of languages and classes provided by the .NET framework.

My hope is that this tutorial will give you a sense of how the experience of building an ASP.NET MVC application is both similar and different than the experience of building an Active Server Pages or ASP.NET Web Forms application.
